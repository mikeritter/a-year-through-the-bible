# A year through the bible

 My journey exploring major themes throughout the Bible across a year

- Winter: a new covenant
- Spring: spreading the gospel
- Summer: God's chosen people
- Autumn: exile and anticipation

## A New Covenant

1. Messiah Has Come
2. The Forerunner of Messiah
3. Trials and Temptations
4. A Voice In the Wilderness
5. My Beloved Son
